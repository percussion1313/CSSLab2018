            <p>A boy gives a cookie to a mouse. The mouse asks for a glass of milk. He then requests a straw (to drink the milk),
                a mirrorto avoid a milk mustache), nail scissors (to trim his hair in the mirror), and a broom (to sweep
                up his hair trimmings). Next he wants to take a nap, have a story read to him, draw a picture, and hang the
                drawing on the refrigerator. Looking at the refrigerator makes him

                unto Him; that is, they must commit suicide. The sign finally comes, and a good ten years later, Tender becomes
                the last surviving member of the cult. He is thrown into mainstream culture and becomes a personal
